# VirtualGarden

This garden lets you add flowers and move them around! Be a little bit gentle with the dragging because it's a bit glitchy. We implemented the dragging using this tutorial:

It didn't generalize very well to multiple flowers and so is a little glitchy on desktop. Refinements should be possible but we ran out of time.
